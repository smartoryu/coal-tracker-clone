        To fix the climate crisis, the world needs to stop burning coal as fast as
        possible.

        One-third of all carbon emissions come from burning coal, making it the
        single largest contributor to climate change.

        Thankfully, advancements in renewable energy technologies mean that coal is
        no longer necessary and the work to phase it out is already well underway.
        The US has shuttered or announced plans to retire more than 65% of its coal
        plants over the last decade, and nearly half of Europe&apos;s coal fleet has
        been confirmed for retirement in just the past five years. Progress
        isn&apos;t just happening â€” it&apos;s accelerating.

        The Bloomberg Global Coal Countdown has one singular mission: To track and
        count down the world&apos;s remaining coal plant units as decision makers
        across governments and the private sector work together to accelerate the
        transition to a clean energy future.
